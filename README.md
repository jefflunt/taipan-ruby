One of the games I absolutely loved growing up was an Apple ][e game called
Taipan. I found [a version of it online][online-taipan] that seems to be basically identical, but
converted into JavaScript from the original BASIC. The JavaScript version, BTW,
is incredibly faithful and totally fun to play. Did I mention it's also free?

The entire game is also a mere 900 or so lines of code. This repo is my attempt
to rewrite the game mechanics in Ruby. I'd like to do this as a game you can
play on your terminal, because as a developer I always loved games that you can
play on a simple command line.
