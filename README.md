One of the games I absolutely loved growing up was an `Apple ][e` game called
`Taipan`. I found [a version of it online][online-taipan] that seems to be basically identical, but
converted into JavaScript from the original BASIC. The JavaScript version, BTW,
is incredibly faithful and totally fun to play. Did I mention it's also free?

The entire game is also a mere 900 or so lines of BASIC. This repo was my attempt
to directly port the game to Ruby. However, I eventually gave up on porting the code
directly and instead wrote a sort of sequel to it called `Plunder & Profit`, which you
can play over ssh. Details are [here][lbg-plunder].
